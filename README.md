crop prediction and recommendation model using machine learning
I developed a crop prediction and recommendation model that assists farmers in selecting suitable crops based on location, season, area, and production metrics and also provides recommendations by analyzing soil nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, pH), rainfall, and other environmental factors, achieving a accuracy of 98%.
